# Hi ^_^

### Follow the steps to open:

1. `clone` repo:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/friedavocadoes/LumberGumber/
  ```
  >[!TIP]
  > or download latest `pre-release` *(on the right)*

2. Open `LumberGumber`:
   ```
   cd LumberGumber
   ```
   
  >[!NOTE]
  >If you downloaded `zip`, then extract → open folder → open a terminal window in the directory.<br>
  >*As an alternative to terminal, it is recommended to open the directory in [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).*

3. Run development server:
  ```
  npm run dev
  ```


## Required Dependencies

Since **package.json** is included, use `npm i` in root directory to install all node dependencies at once.

Others<br>    
  
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

### Push requests and issues are appreciated :)

>[!CAUTION]
>Do not clone `testonly` branch.
